## ðŸš€ Phase-wise Features

### **Phase 1 â€“ OCR & CSV Structuring**

* Generate **synthetic Indian-style invoices**.
* Perform **OCR** using `pytesseract`.
* Extract fields via **regex & parsing**:

  * Invoice No, Date, Buyer Name, Buyer Address, PAN, GSTIN, Items, Quantity, Rate, Amount, Taxes, Total, Terms.
* Save extracted records to `data/structured_csv/invoice_data.csv`.


Phase 2 â€“ EDA Dashboard & Database
Streamlit dashboard with:

 Raw data table
 Column summaries
 Top items analysis
 Sales trends
 Correlation heatmaps
 Distribution plots
 Data cleaning (drop nulls & sensitive columns).
Store cleaned data in SQLite(`invoice_data.db`).



Phase 3 â€“ Invoice Builder & Editor

Create invoices directly in UI.
Edit existing invoices.
Upload invoices for OCR & auto-extraction.
Download or print generated invoices.


Phase 4 â€“ Multi-User Mode with Preloaded Data

 User-based storage:

   Each user gets their own CSV & DB.
  `devu_05`account is preloaded with 2000+ invoices for instant EDA access.
   Other users start with an empty database.
 Secure login & registration system.




## ðŸ“Œ Usage Guide

1. Login / Register via the app.
2. If `devu_05` â€“ youâ€™ll see preloaded data with full EDA.
3. Other users â€“ start fresh and upload invoices.
4. Create / Edit / Upload invoices  interface.
5. Analyze data in the EDA dashboard.



## ðŸ“Š Example Visualizations

* Top 10 sold items (bar chart)
* Daily revenue trend (line chart)
* GST distribution (pie chart)
* Price variation (box plot)
* Correlation between numeric fields (heatmap)


## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Regex, PyTesseract, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Streamlit (Interactive Dashboard)
SQLite (Data storage)
PIL (Invoice generation)
OS / Pathlib (File handling)
